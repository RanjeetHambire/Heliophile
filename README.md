# Heliophile

Heliophile is a lover of the sunðŸ˜œ. It is a single-axis solar tracking system uses a tilted PV panel mount and one electric motor to move the panel on an approximate trajectory relative to the Sun's position

## Project Overview

Sun ðŸŒž Tracking Solar Panel using Arduino, In which we will use two LDRs (Light-dependent Resistor) to sense the light and a servo motor to automatically rotate the solar panel in the direction of sunlight. 
  
   The advantage of this project is that the solar panel will always follow the sunlight will always face the sun to get charge all the time and can provide the supply the maximum Power.

## Features:
1. Live sun tracking with LDR: Tracking the sun automatically using 2 LDR is one of the feature this project has. I achieve this by  calculating The difference between 2 LDR, and comparing the difference with an error threshold of 5.

2. Adjust solar panel to face towards the sunlight: After tracking, another feature of project is to adjust the solar pane to face towards the sun maximum power output
